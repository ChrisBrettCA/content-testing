        <p>
          We’ve written some new advice about benefits and we’d like your help
          to improve the content.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’ve made a few short tasks so advisers can help test some of the new
          advice.
        </p>
        <p>
          By completing these tasks you’ll help us improve our benefits advice
          for the public and other advisers.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are 4 tasks - it should take about 5 minutes to complete them
          all.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re not sure how to complete a task you can skip it by clicking
          'Next'.
